# MIDS_Stats_22Fall

This repository contains assignments for **IDS702 Modeling and Representation** of Data at Duke.

There are 4 individual assignments and 1 group project of modeling and analyzing data using `R programming language`.

## Individual Assignments
`Assignment 1 --- Linear Regression Model`
1. Predicting respiratory rates from age
2. Understand how certain factors influence the price of a Airbnb listing

`Assignment 2 --- Mutiple Linear Regression Model`
1. Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park and its eruptions
   Predicting the interval between eruptions from the duration of the previous one.
   Predicting interval from duration and day
2. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) and newborn weights

`Assignment 3 --- Logistic Regression Model`
* Predicting win or loss of an NBA game

`Assignment 4 --- GLM: Multinomial Logistic Regressin, Proportional Odds Model`
* Explore which services are worth investing in to improve customer satisfaction for LaneAir.

## Group Project
This project examines how the ride sharing industry, particularly Uber and Lyft, operates in the United States and how the ride prices and customer’s choice of ride are affected by multiple factors like ride’s distance, time, and weather.

* Using the **multiple linear regression model**, this project analyses how ride prices for Uber and Lyft are affected by different factors related to the ride. 

* Employing the **logistic regression model** to predict how consumer’s decision of selecting Uber as their ride of choice is affected by other factors.
